        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a standard style sheet
        language used for describing the presentation (i.e. the layout and
        formatting) of the web pages. Prior to CSS, nearly all of the
        presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the
        HTML markup (specifically inside the HTML tags); all the font colors,
        background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be
        explicitly described within the HTML. As a result, development of the
        large websites became a long and expensive process, since the style
        information were repeatedly added to every single page of the website.
        To solve this problem CSS was introduced in 1996 by the World Wide Web
        Consortium (W3C), which also maintains its standard. CSS was designed to
        enable the separation of presentation and content. Now web designers can
        move the formatting information of the web pages to a separate style
        sheet which results in considerably simpler HTML markup, and better
        maintainability.
