        Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web
        development. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for
        creating common user interface components like forms, buttons,
        navigations, dropdowns, alerts, modals, tabs, accordions, carousels,
        tooltips, and so on. Bootstrap gives you ability to create flexible and
        responsive web layouts with much less efforts. Bootstrap was originally
        created by a designer and a developer at Twitter in mid-2010. Before
        being an open-sourced framework, Bootstrap was known as Twitter
        Blueprint. You can save a lot of time and effort with Bootstrap. So
